                There is only one reason because of which any website exists on world wide web:
                <strong>Promotion.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no promotion possible if it is not capable of gaining people's attention.
                So, a website which does not generate traffic is practically useless!</p>

                Following are our <strong>top 10 SEO tips</strong> every website owner/designer
                should take into consideration.</p>
            <h2>
                Domain Name</h2>
            <p>
                Your domain name must be easy to remember, easy to spell, easy to say and brandable
                i.e. Facebook, Google, Yahoo!, etc. Don't worry about using keywords in your domain
                name. Using keywords in domain names doesn't have much of a punch anymore.</p>
            <h2>
                Keep it simple</h2>
            <p>
                Try your level best to keep the design of your website as simple as possible. Otherwise,
                chances are that it will hinder your visitors' ability to navigate and view the
                site. Complex design will also have a negative impact on the cost of your website.</p>
            <h2>
                Title</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most important factor of getting higher <strong>rank in SERPs</strong>
                (Search Engine Result Page) is by using appropriate title for every webpage of your
                site.
            </p>
            <h2>
                META Tags</h2>
            <p>
                Never neglect Description and Keyword META tag. Be very smart in generating these
                two tags. Information written in these tags is not visible to your visitors but
                search engines are known to make good use of the information found in these tags.</p>
            <h2>
                Bells and Wishtles</h2>
            <p>
                Don't try to add too many bells and whistles in your website. And specially try
                to avoid flash, silverlight and excessive use of pictures. Try to use as much of
                text as possible so as to make it readable by search engines. Try to use JavaScript
                for animation of text and pictures. Too many bells and wishtles can also distract
                your vistors from the actual content you want them to read or learn.</p>
            <h2>
                Using keywords in filenames and directories</h2>
            <p>
                Name your files and directories according to the content they would be holding.
                Use hyphens in filenames or directories instead of underscore.</p>
            <h2>
                ALT tag</h2>
            <p>
                ALT tag is basi­cally an alter­na­tive descrip­tion of your image. When search engine
                spiders crawl your website, they can't see your images but they can read the description
                you have provided about your image.</p>
            <h2>
                Anchor Text</h2>
            <p>
                Anchor text is the visible text of a hyperlink. It should be relavent to the link
                and would be even better if you extract anchor text from your link.
                <br />
                i.e. <code>&lt; href="http://www.anewweborder.com/registration.html"&gt;<strong>Registration</strong>&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This can give your website a boost in search engine ranking.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Inter­link Your Pages</h2>
            <p>
                Some people are so obsessed with get­ting qual­ity links from other websites that
                they for­get the most basic step of interlinking their own pages.</p>
            <p>
                This can do a num­ber of tricks for you. By inter­link­ing pages, you are basi­cally
                select­ing key­words from the content in your pages. This increases the pageviews
                on site , and makes it eas­ier for search engines to travel deep into your site.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Site Map</h2>
            <p>
                Never forget to create sitemap for your website. You can have either an html sitemap
                or xml sitemap. It is considered a good idea to submit your sitemap to major search
                engines in case of any modification to your website content.</p>
