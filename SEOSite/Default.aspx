            <h2>What is Virtual Search Engine Optimization (VSEO)?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Virtual Search Engine Optimization (VSEO)</strong> is a web marketing protocol which has
                been developed by aNewWebOrder.com, Inc. This protocol is designed specifically
                with one objective in mind, that is, to give charge of web marketing directly into
                the hands of website owners, so they can promote their websites or offering at their
                websites in least amount of time and with least amount of money being invested.
                This also means that you do not need to hire someone or spend crazy amount of time
                (if you have programming skills) to optimize your website for search engine visibility.
